## Why ToolZ ? 😄
1. **Unfollower Tracking:** Toolz allows users to track and identify accounts that have unfollowed them on Instagram. It keeps a record of users who were previously following but have since decided to stop.
2. **Real-Time Notifications:** The script may provide real-time notifications to users whenever someone unfollows them on Instagram, ensuring they are promptly informed of any changes in their follower count.
3. **Historical Data:** Toolz maintains a history of unfollowers over time, allowing users to view past unfollowers and track patterns in their follower base.
4. **Whitelist and Blacklist:** Users may have the option to create a whitelist and blacklist. The whitelist excludes specific accounts from being tracked, while the blacklist prioritizes tracking for selected accounts.
5. **Analytics and Insights:** Toolz provide users with analytics and insights into their follower changes. This can include graphs and statistics showing follower growth, unfollowers, and trends.
6. **User-Friendly Interface:** Toolz offers a user-friendly interface or report that displays unfollower data in a clear and organized manner.
