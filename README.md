# InstaTools 🧰

InstaTools is a variety of tools intended for Instagram. Each one of them automates actions which manually would take a huge amount of time (Especially if the target user has a big amount of followers). These tools can also be used for researching purposes (like when you want to know how many users follow verified accounts). But keep in mind that using InstaTools too often can get your account suspended (or even blocked !). So avoid using it too often.
